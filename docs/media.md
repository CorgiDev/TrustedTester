## 17. Synchronized Media

### Pre-Recorded Synchronized Media

#### Identify Content

Identify any pre-recorded synchronized multimedia content.

**EXCLUDE** media that is clearly identified as a media alternative for text.

If there is no such content, the result for the following test ID(s) is **DOES NOT APPLY**: 17A and 17.B.

#### Check 1.2.2-captions-equivalent 

| Test Name                 | Test ID | Test Condition                                                                                                |
|---------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.2.2-captions-equivalent | 17.A    | <span id="OLE_LINK102" class="anchor"></span>The multimedia provides accurate captions for the audio content. |

##### Applicability

This Test Condition **DOES NOT APPLY (DNA)** if there is no pre-recorded synchronized media.

##### How to Test:

1.  Enable captions through the multimedia player functions and play the media.

    1.  A separate media file with captions may be provided to meet this requirement (i.e. captioned media version is a different file). If provided, test that one.

2.  Listen to the audio of the entire synchronized media. Compare the audio to the captions for accuracy, time-synchronization, and equivalence.

    1.  Captions should include all dialogue and equivalents for non-dialogue audio information needed to understand the program content, including sound effects, music, laughter, speaker identification and location.

    2.  The definition of captions includes synchronization. If they are not synchronized, they are not considered captions.

    3.  Captions must not obscure relevant content on the video.

##### Evaluate Results: 

If ALL of the following are **TRUE**, then the Test Condition is **TRUE** and the content **PASSES**:

1.  Captions are provided for all multimedia content, AND

2.  Captions are accurate and include all dialogue and equivalents for non-dialogue audio information needed to understand the program content, including sound effects, e.g., music, laughter, speaker identification and location, AND

3.  All other relevant information in the video is clearly visible (not obstructed by captions) when captions are enabled.

###### Note:

-   Transcripts and non-synchronized alternatives alone will not meet this requirement.

#### Check 1.2.5-audio-description-equivalent

| Test Name                          | Test ID | Test Condition                                                                                                            |
|------------------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.2.5-audio-description-equivalent | 17.B    | The multimedia provides an equivalent soundtrack (combination of narration and audio descriptions) for the video content. |

##### Applicability

This Test Condition **DOES NOT APPLY (DNA)** if there is no pre-recorded synchronized media.

##### How to Test:

1.  Enable audio descriptions through multimedia player and play the media.

    1.  Audio descriptions are narration added to or combined with the soundtrack to describe important visual details that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone.

    2.  A separate media file with audio description may be provided to meet this requirement (i.e. audio description media file is a different file). If provided, test that one.

2.  Identify visual content that requires narrative descriptions.

3.  Determine whether the main soundtrack combined with audio descriptions adequately describe important visual details (actions, characters, scene changes, onscreen text, etc.) for a viewer who is unable to see the content.

    1.  If the primary audio adequately describes important visual content in the media, including information about actions, characters, scene changes, onscreen text, speaker identification and location, and other visual content, additional audio description is not necessary.

4.  Compare the video to the combined soundtrack and review the soundtrack for accuracy, time-synchronization, and equivalence.

    1.  Audio descriptions are inserted in pauses in dialog. Synchronization may not be possible, but the description should be provided as timely as possible so meaning is preserved.

##### Evaluate Results:

If the following is **TRUE**, then the content **PASSES**:

1.  The soundtrack (combination of audio descriptions and narration) adequately describes important visual content in the media, including information about actions, characters, scene changes, onscreen text, and other visual content.

###### Note:

-   Transcripts and non-synchronized alternatives alone will not meet this requirement.

### Live Synchronized Media

#### Identify Content

Identify any live synchronized multimedia content. These requirements are only intended for broadcast of synchronized media.

**EXCLUDE** two-way multimedia calls between two or more individuals through web apps.

If there is no such content, the result for the following test ID(s) is **DOES NOT APPLY**: 17.C.

#### Check 1.2.4-captions-live-equivalent 

| Test Name                      | Test ID | Test Condition                                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.2.4-captions-live-equivalent | 17.C    | <span id="OLE_LINK105" class="anchor"></span>The live multimedia provides accurate captions for the audio content. |

##### Applicability

This Test Condition **DOES NOT APPLY (DNA)** if there is no live synchronized media.

##### How to Test:

1.  Enable captions through multimedia player functions.

2.  Listen to the audio of the synchronized media. Compare the audio to the captions for accuracy, time-synchronization, and equivalence.

    1.  Lower accuracy of captions for live broadcasts may be acceptable due to limitations of real-time caption capabilities.

    2.  The definition of captions includes synchronization. If they are not synchronized, they are not considered captions.

##### Evaluate Results:

If ALL of the following are **TRUE**, then the content **PASSES**:

1.  Captions are provided for all live multimedia, AND

2.  All captions are accurate, AND

3.  Any discrepancies between the captions and the audio output are minor in nature and do not significantly impact understanding (applicable to live captioning only).

### Media Player Controls

#### Identify Content

Identify any media player used to display synchronized video and audio content.

If there is no such content, the result for the following test ID(s) is **DOES NOT APPLY**: 17.D to 17.F.

#### Check 503.4-caption-description-controls 

| Test Name                          | Test ID | Test Condition                                                                      |
|------------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 503.4-caption-description-controls | 17.D    | The media player provides user controls for closed captions and audio descriptions. |

##### Applicability:

This Test Condition **DOES NOT APPLY (DNA)** if there is no media player or if the media player DOES NOT present video synchronized with audio (i.e., it presents audio-only or video-only).

##### How to Test: 

1.  Locate the controls for selection of closed captions and audio descriptions.

##### Evaluate Results:

If the following is **TRUE**, then the content **PASSES**:

1.  The media player provides user controls for closed captions AND audio descriptions.

### Media Player – Caption Controls at Volume Menu Level

#### Identify Content

Identify any media player with volume adjustment control(s).

If there is no such content, the result for the following test ID(s) is **DOES NOT APPLY**: 17.E.

#### Check 503.4.1-caption-control 

| Test Name               | Test ID | Test Condition                                                                                                       |
|-------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 503.4.1-caption-control | 17.E    | User controls for captions are provided at the same menu level as the user controls for volume or program selection. |

##### Applicability:

This Test Condition **DOES NOT APPLY (DNA)** if there is no media player or the media player does not have a volume adjustment control.

##### How to Test: 

1.  Continue from Test 17.D.

2.  Locate the user controls for volume selection and program selection.

##### Evaluate Results:

If the following is **TRUE**, then the content **PASSES**:

1.  The user controls for captions are provided at the same menu level as the volume controls or program selection controls.

### Media Player – Audio Description Controls at Program Menu Level

#### Identify Content

Identify any media player with program selection control(s).

> **Note:** Program selection is a feature of a media player that allows the user to choose what presentation, or portion of a longer presentation, to play. Program selection is typically the same user experience as opening a file or using a table of contents. The media controls to view an open file (play, pause, fast forward, rewind, etc.) are NOT considered program selection controls.
>
> In most web implementations, media players are typically provided to view specific synchronized media so program selection controls to open any file are not common. Program selection controls to advance to the identified topics in the media (sometimes referred to as “chapters”) may be provided. Volume control is treated as a unique control, distinct from program selection controls.

If there is no such content, the result for the following test ID(s) is **DOES NOT APPLY**: 17.F.

#### Check 503.4.2-description-control 

| Test Name                   | Test ID | Test Condition                                                                                                                                                              |
|-----------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 503.4.2-description-control | 17.F    | <span id="OLE_LINK109" class="anchor"></span>User controls for audio descriptions are provided at the same menu level as the user controls for program selection or volume. |
