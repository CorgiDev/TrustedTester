## 16. Pre-Recorded Audio-Only, Video-Only, and Animations

### Pre-Recorded Audio Only

#### Identify Content

Identify all pre-recorded audio-only content.

**EXCLUDE** any audio-only content that:

-   Is clearly labeled as a media alternative for text, OR

-   Consists of short sounds used to notify the user, such as confirmation beeps and error notifications.

If there is no such content, the result for the following test ID(s) is **DOES NOT APPLY**: 16.A.

**Note**:

-   If audio is *synchronized* with video, slides, animations, or other time-based visual media, use the synchronized media tests in Section 17.

#### Check 1.2.1-audio-transcript-text 

| Test Name                   | Test ID | Test Condition                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 1.2.1-audio-transcript-text | 16.A    | <span id="OLE_LINK97" class="anchor"></span>A text-based alternative is provided for audio-only content that provides an accurate and complete representation of the audio-only content. |

##### Applicability:

This Test Condition **DOES NOT APPLY (DNA)** if there is no pre-recorded audio-only content.

##### How to Test:

1.  Determine if, for each audio-only content, a transcript is provided.

    1.  Determine whether each transcript is text, (i.e., an image of a transcript would *not* be sufficient to pass this test).

2.  Play the audio-only content entirely while reviewing the transcript.

3.  Determine whether the information in the transcript is an accurate, correctly sequenced, and complete representation of the audio-only content.

    1.  To be a complete representation of the content, the transcript must also describe relevant sounds in addition to dialogue, such as doors banging, sirens wailing, identification of speakers in dialogue, etc.

##### Evaluate Results:

If ALL of the following are **TRUE**, then the content **PASSES**:

1.  A text-based transcript is provided for all audio-only content, AND

2.  The transcript is an accurate and complete representation of the audio-only content.

### Pre-recorded Video

#### Identify Content

Identify all pre-recorded video-only content.

-   In a video-only presentation, information is presented in a variety of ways including animation, text or graphics, the setting and background, the actions and expressions of people, animals, etc.

**EXCLUDE** any video-only intended as a media alternative for text *if* it is clearly labeled as such.

If there is no such content, the result for the following test ID(s) is **DOES NOT APPLY**: 16.B.

**Note**:

-   If the video is accompanied by timed sounds or meaningful dialog, it is not video-only; use the *synchronized media* tests in section 17.

#### Check 1.2.1-video- alternative-equivalent 

| Test Name                           | Test ID | Test Condition                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.2.1-video- alternative-equivalent | 16.B    | <span id="OLE_LINK100" class="anchor"></span>The video-only content information is also available through an equivalent text or audio alternative. |

##### Applicability:

This Test Condition **DOES NOT APPLY (DNA)** if there is no pre-recorded video-only content.

##### How to Test:

1.  Determine whether a text or audio alternative is provided for all video-only content (such as a transcript in text that provides a description of video content and actions or an audio track).

> **Note:** An image of a transcript does not meet this requirement.

1.  Play the video-only content entirely while reviewing the text or audio alternative.

2.  Determine whether the information in the text or audio alternative includes the same information that the video-only presentation displays (e.g., if the video includes multiple characters, the alternative must identify which character is associated with each depicted action).

##### Evaluate Results:

If ALL of the following are **TRUE**, then the content **PASSES**:

1.  A text or audio alternative is provided for all video-only content, AND

2.  The text or audio alternative is an accurate and complete representation of the video-only content.
